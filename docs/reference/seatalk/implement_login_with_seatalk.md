# Implement Login With SeaTalk

**Source:** https://open.seatalk.io/docs/implement-login-with-seatalk

Please note that the minimum mobile client version required for Login with SeaTalk is 3.17.

In this article, we will walk you through how to implement Login with SeaTalk on your website. The following steps need to be done: 

- Create an app on SeaTalk Open Platform

- Configure your service's Redirect URI on SeaTalk Open Platform

- Add in Login With SeaTalk JS framework on your website so that you can redirect users to the SeaTalk Login Page

- Get user identity after the SeaTalk server directs back to your service after a user authenticates the login with SeaTalk

## Create an App

First, create an app on SeaTalk Open Platform by filling out information of your app. After you have developed your website and are ready to link Login with SeaTalk with the website, navigate to the Basic Info section of your app's detail page and get the App ID.


## Add in Login With SeaTalk JS Framework

You can easily add a standard Login with Seatalk Button to your website by using the HTML and JavaScript Library. When a user taps the login button, he/she will be redirected to the SeaTalk Login Page, as described in Login with SeaTalk Overview (../../../../../../docs/login-with-seatalk-overview).

See the following code snippet for an example:

```
<div id="seatalk_login_app_info" data-redirect_uri="[YOUR_REDIRECT_URI]" data-appid="[YOUR_APPID]" data-response_type="code" data-state="[STATE]"></div> 
<div id="seatalk_login_button" data-size="small" data-logo_size="22" data-copywriting="Continue with SeaTalk" data-theme="light" data-align="center"></div> 
<script src="https://static.cdn.haiserve.com/seatalk/client/shared/sop/auth.js">
</script>
```

An element with the ID seatalk_login_app_info is used to specify the information of your app on SeaTalk Open Platform：

| Data Attributes | Value | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data-appid | String | Yes | Your app's App ID, which is the unique identifier of your app |
| data-redirect_uri | String | Yes | The redirection endpoint URI after successful authorization |
| data-response_type | code | Yes | - The authorized type - Value must be set to "code" |
| data-state | String | No | - A value used by the client to maintain the state between the request and callback. When the authorization is successful, data-state will be appended to the redirect URI for verification - The parameter should be used for preventing the case where unauthorized commands are submitted from a user that the website trusts ("request forgery" or "session riding") |

An element with the ID seatalk_login_button will be rendered as a Login With SeaTalk button. You can customize the button by the parameters provided in the data attributes below:

| Data Attributes | Value | Mandatory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data-size | small | default | large | No | The size of the button |
| data-align | center | border | No | - The alignment of the button icon and text - Default: center |
| data-theme | default | dark | No | The theme of the button |
| data-logo_size | String | No | - The size of the SeaTalk Logo - Default: 22 pixels |
| data-copywriting | String | No | - The copywriting of the button - Default: Login with SeaTalk |

SeaTalk Open Platform provides design guidelines for the Login with SeaTalk button. See Button Design Guidelines (../../../../../../docs/button-design-guidelines) for detail.

You can also enable the One-Tap login method for your website. See One-Tap Login (../../../../../../docs/login-with-seatalk-one-tap-login) for how to turn on the capability.

## Get User Identity

After users grant your app on the SeaTalk Login Page the permission to access their SeaTalk profile, they will be redirected to the service you provided before in the data-redirect_uri attributes within the code.

Upon redirection, an authorization code will be appended at the end of the redirect URI for your service as a temporary token that carries the user information. An example of the redirect URI is https://www.yourwebsite.com/?code=1f2b62b4210448a19ac1a83da59fb32c&state=test.

The token will expire after 10 minutes. You can use the code to exchange for the user profile information by calling Verify Login with SeaTalk Code (../../../../../../docs/code-to-employee) API.
